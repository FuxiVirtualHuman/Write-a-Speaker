# Write-a-Speaker
The emotional Motion Capture dataset has been introduced in our paper of “[Write-a-speaker: Text-based Emotional and Rhythmic Talking-head Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07995.pdf)” published in AAAI2021. The [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weHA6LHv-Ew) shows the generated talking face results relying on the dataset. Some examples of facial expression blendshapes are illustrated as blow. The full 51 facial expression blendshapes can be observed in **./images**.
